s.description      = <<-DESC
NRAppUpdate enables the app to detect whether the new version of the app is available on AppStore. For ex: During the launch of the app, it checks for update and shows the prompt accordingly. So you just have to use single line of code NRAppUpdate.checkUpdate(for: "---YOUR APP ITUNES ID---") to enable this.
